## Background  

Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) usually trade close to their Net Asset Value (NAV). However, during periods of market stress or low liquidity, ETF prices may significantly deviate from NAV, creating premiums or discounts. For decision-makers, understanding whether these deviations are driven by liquidity or other factors is critical for managing risk, identifying arbitrage opportunities, and maintaining efficient markets.  

---

## Project Objectives  

This project aims to answer:  
1. **Is there a significant relationship between ETF premiums/discounts and market liquidity?**  
2. **Under what market conditions do premiums/discounts widen?**  
3. **Can liquidity indicators be used to predict or provide early warnings for deviations?**  

---

## Stakeholders and Users  

- **Stakeholders (Decision-Makers):** Portfolio managers, market makers  
- **Users (Operators):** Quantitative researchers, data analysts  

---

## Useful Results  

- **Descriptive:** Historical analysis of the relationship between premiums/discounts and liquidity metrics (bid-ask spread, trading volume).  
- **Predictive:** Early-warning models indicating when premiums/discounts may widen.  
- **Optional Causal Insight:** Exploration of whether liquidity deterioration directly drives deviations.  

---

## Assumptions & Constraints  

- ETF NAV and price data are publicly available (e.g., Yahoo Finance, ETF.com, SEC filings).  
- Liquidity indicators are representative of real market conditions.  
- Extreme events (e.g., trading halts, direct policy interventions) are excluded.  

---

## Known Risks  

- Missing or delayed NAV data.  
- Structural or regulatory changes in ETF markets.  
- Premiums/discounts may be influenced by multiple drivers (flows, arbitrage costs) beyond liquidity.  

---

## Next Steps  

1. Collect ETF price, NAV, and trading data.  
2. Compute premiums/discounts and liquidity indicators.  
3. Conduct descriptive and correlation analysis.  
4. Build preliminary predictive models and validate results.

✉️ **Conclusion**  
This project will provide decision-makers with actionable insights into how ETF premiums/discounts are linked to market liquidity, supporting better trading and risk management strategies.
